# Password Generator (PyQt5)

A simple **GUI-based password generator** built with **Python** and **PyQt5**.  
This tool allows you to quickly generate secure 16-character passwords by selecting character sets such as:

- ppercase letters (A–Z)  
- Lowercase letters (a–z)  
- Numbers (0–9)  
- Symbols (!@#$%^&* etc.)  

If no options are selected, the app will remind you to choose at least one.
